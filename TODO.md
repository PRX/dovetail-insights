- Write validations and tests specific to the Dimensional lens
- Write validations and tests specific to the Time Series lens
- Write tests for the various #from_params methods
- Figure out if we want to support time zones for the range selection at all. The app only thinks in terms of UTC.
  - I vote no, at least to start.
  - If/when we do want to support time zones at all, it must be done entirely on the client side, the `from` and `to` values in the URL query will always be UTC-only.
- Figure out a UI for filter multi-selects.
  - Things like podcast_id, country_id, timezone, etc.
  - While some of these are filtering on ID, the user should interact with something more friendly, like the podcast name.
  - The values available for these filters for any given user should probably be cached somewhere.
- Add validations for values that must be authorized, like podcast_id.
  - The app needs to ensure that it will never query a database for resources that the user isn't authorized to access. The UI should only present authorized values, but check them again before the query is actually sent.
- If the user adds an exclude filter on an impression dimension (like advertiser), but only selects downloads as a metric, ensure that all downloads associated with that advertiser are excluded, even if there are other impression rows for that download for other advertisers.
- When using EXTRACT on timestamps, it may be helpful to be able to decide if the extract should use the timezone or not. If a user is extracting, for example, on download time, they likely would expect a download at 5 PM ET and 5 PM PT to be treated the same way, but when using EXTRACT without a timezone, they would get treated more like midnight at 2 AM.
  - Need to verify what happens with downloads that don't have a timezone

- Maybe allow filters/groups/etc to reference the composition time range from/to?
- If we have a value in the data some point that indicates if an episode was originally published before it was hosted on Dovetail, add a warning that the data is incomplete
- Separate permissions for downloads and impressions
- Write some tests to check rolling window ranges down to the second
- SortFields don't resolve exhibit properties. Make a note somewhere that you should ensure the desired property is used directly. Meta properties also don't resolve exhibit properties, which makes it possible to display, for example, podcast ID if desired, rather than podcast name.
- May want to have an option that allows enforcing empty rows (i.e., display all possible group members, even if there is no data)
  - For some dimensions, it is tricky/expensive to generate the list of members
- With 0 groups in time series, or 1 group in dimensional, allow values in the table to be displayed as a percent
- Look into using pipe syntax for BigQuery queries https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/pipe-syntax-guide
- Add a preflight tubro thing that the composition can be submitted to to get real time warnings and errors without having to run the query
- Move DataSchemaUtils
- Figure out access for podcasts, episodes, campaigns, advertisers, etc. Do we keep piggybacking off feeder/augury permissions?
- Write tests for results, particularly around edge case math
- Cume: Should be able to compare episodes across a very long period, like if a show has been around for 10 years, and you want to compare the first episode to the most recent epsiode. This would require setting the composition time range to 10 years, which could result in huge query results. Enforce some sensible limits to the number of episodes that can be included in any composition once the range gets over some limit, by requiring a episode INCLUDE filter
- Cume: Support impressions
