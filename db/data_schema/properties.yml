# Properties are aspects of the data that we do not think are meaningful in
# terms of filtering, grouping, etc.
#
# Anything defined as a property _could_ be, instead, defined as a
# **dimension**, from a technical standpoint. This is a subjective/opinionated
# choice that we are making to build the app in a way that best meets the needs
# of the user.
#
# For example, something like `episode name` may be listed as a property. This
# means that data cannot be filtered or grouped by episode name in the app. It
# does not mean that data couldn't theoretically be grouped by episode name; it
# is certainly possible to group all episodes called "Preview" together.
# Practically, there is very little reason to do this. One could even argue
# that it may be helpful to filter by episode title (maybe a user wants to
# include only episodes that have the word "president" in their title). This is
# a valid argument, but we currently use a unified model for which data aspects
# are available for filtering and grouping, so some cases like that may not be
# supported at the moment.
#
# Properties are aspects of data that aren't useful for filtering, grouping,
# etc, but still are helpful or necessary to present meaningful data to the
# user. For example, when data is grouped by a dimension like `episode ID`, it
# makes sense to present the episodes' titles to the user, not just an abstract
# ID.
#
# Each property is defined as a key under the `Properties` object. The key is
# arbitrary and used only within the context of this application. There is
# generally a relationship between a property and values in databases, but a
# property's key does not need to, for example, match the name of column in a
# database.
#
# When properties and dimensions reference other values, those references are
# made using these arbitrary keys. The underlying SQL query (or similar) is
# then constructed in a way that makes sense for the data store being queried.
