# Dimensions are aspects of the data that we think are meaningful in terms of
# filtering, grouping, etc.
#
# Each dimension has a type, and different types have different behaviors in
# the contexts of grouping, filtering, etc. Not all dimension make sense to
# filter or group using raw vales. For example, `publish date` dimension may
# have a type of `Timestamp`, indicating that the values for that dimension
# represent specific moments in time. Grouping data into infinitely small
# moments in time likely doesn't provide much value to a user. Grouping data
# into groups based on the month extracted from pub dates is more beneficial.
#
# So these dimensions do not strictly represent data that may be present in any
# particular database, but instead describe concepts that can be derived from
# the data available in various databases.
#
# The properties of each dimension, like Type, help the app determine how a
# user should be able to interact with each dimension.
#
# All tables referenced in these definitions are virtual tables defined in
# tables.yml

      # zone represented in that string to be UTC. We then parse that string,
