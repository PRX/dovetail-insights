`Type`: This is an indication of how the resulting value is treated by the app. It is **not** strictly the same as the types of any underlying fields in the database, `String`, `Token`, `Duration`, `Timestamp`

`StaticProperties`: For a given dimension, when data is grouped by that dimension, all data within that group will have the same values for properties and dimensions listed under `StaticProperties`. For example, when data is grouped by `episode_id`, the group for `epiosde_id=123` will also have a single value for `episode_title` (since episode 123 only has a single title) and `podcast_id` (since an episode can only belong to a single podcast), etc.

`ExhibitProperty`: If a dimension should always use the value of another dimension or property when being displayed to the user, this will indicate that property or dimension. Note that it can be a property _or_ dimension, even though it's called `ExhibitProperty`. The property or dimension used for `ExhibitProperty` must also be (correctly) listed under `StaticProperties` for the dimension. The `ExhibitProperty` will be SELECTed and JOINed whenever the dimension is included in a query, so the values will always be available.
