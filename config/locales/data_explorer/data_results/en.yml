  group_member_labels:
    # You can explicitly define specific group member labels. If you list an
    # override under `descriptors`, you must list the raw descriptor value,
    # which may be an ID like 42. If you list an override under `exhibitions`,
    # though, you can override by exhibit property value, like "WatchOS". But
    # be aware that if the exhbit property value changes the override will
    # break. Descriptor overides have priority. See `GroupMemberLabelHelper`.
    #
    # Note that the dimension names used here are the real dimension names from
    # the schema, not the key that are generally presented in the app UI.
