# Pin npm packages by running ./bin/importmap

# Everything pinned here will be included in the importmap that's generated
# using `javascript_importmap_tags`, _and_ will have a `<script>` tag added to
# the page also by `javascript_importmap_tags`.
#
# If you just need code to be loaded on the page, pinning it here is
# sufficientâ€”you do not need to `import` things in `application.js` unless
# you're actually using the imported modules somewhere in code.

# This is app/javascript/application.js
