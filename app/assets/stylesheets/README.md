Propshaft will find all `.css` files in here, and include them on the page via `stylesheet_link_tag :app`, which will expand into individual `<style>` tags. No pre-processing or processing happens to these files. They are vanilla CSS files.

`.scss` files in here will be ignored by Propshaft. Styles defined in Sass files are generally made available to the site by getting compiled via `yarn build:css:compile`, which will create CSS files in `app/assets/build`, and those **are** handled by Propshaft as vanilla CSS files, and included in the `<style>` tags generated by `stylesheet_link_tag :app`.

In general, it's easiest to import Sass things into `application.scss`, and let compilation of that file handle other files, but if it makes sense to have other, separate Sass files that's fine too, just update the build script to compile them to `assets/builds` as well.
